# Me :)

Hey there! I'm Antlers, a self-taught 3D artist currently studying computer science. 
I started making 3D models for friends, but eventually others began asking me to create models for them too.
My goal with all this is to explore and grow as an artist, both in skill and in different reigimes of the asset-creation domain.

I hope you enjoy my work!

# Pricing
## Model
The base pricing for the model depends on what is being commisioned.
Generally, the appraisal price will range somewhere between `$20` for low-complexity models and `$60` for highly detailed topology.
> [!TIP]
> If reference material is provided \(eg. front, side, or top views\), I'll throw in a `$10` discount. References help you and me!

## Texturing
The skin of your model. Unwrapped/untextured options aren't reccomended for those looking for a simple render.

- Unwrapped: `$0`
- Untextured: `$5`
- Baked Materials: `$15`
- Hand-Painted: `$40`

## Rigging
The limbs of your model. Models that need to strike a pose/aren't completely static are highly recommended to have a rig.
- Unrigged: `$0`
- Rigged, simple: `$15` + `$5` per pose
- Rigged, complex: `$35`+  `$10` per pose

## Animations
The soul of your model. Picture renders don't need any animations, but video renders or game assets may require them.
Scened animations involve the model in some situation. That is, not a blank void.

### Complexity
- Static: `$0`
- Simple: `$15`
- Complex: `$40`

### Scenery
- Unscened: `$0`
- Basic: `$10`
- Custom: `$60`

Additional animations and/or scenes will be counted seperately.

# Product
All assets created during the comissioning process will be provided.
This includes any model files, textures \(baked or painted\), rigging skeletons, animations, scenes, and renders.

Enjoy!

> [!WARNING]
> Adding any additional detail into a commision (eg. baked textures -> hand painted textures, render -> animation)
> will add `+$10` or more fee, depending on how much stuff needs to be redone.
